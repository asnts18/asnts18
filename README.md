## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Abby, an aspiring software engineer with a diverse background in business, analytics, data science, and software development. 

I am currently seeking for SWE internship opportunities. 

### ðŸŒŸ What am I up to?
I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at Northeastern University, currently learning about Computer Systems and Database Management Systems. Previously, in my Mobile App Development class, I built **Save Squad**, an iOS application focused on managing expenses with Firebase as the backend. Outside of school, I am building **GitGood** with two peers from Northeastern Uni, a web app and Chrome extension that guides users navigate the complexities and overcome any intimidation of open source collaboration. I am also preparing for technical interviews through attending CodePath Technical Interview (Intermediate) classes.

### ðŸ“š What's on my learning radar?
Currently sharpening my problem-solving skills by studying algorithms and data structures.

### ðŸ“¬ How to reach me?
Feel free to connect with me via santos.ab@northeastern.edu.

### ðŸŒŸ A fun tidbit about me:
I love expressing my creativity through dancing Jazz Funk, oil and watercolor painting, baking cakes, and exploring different make up styles.

Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out if you'd like to collaborate or have any questions!
